# Heart-Disease-Prediction
# Project Overview

This project is for making prediction on whether a person will suffer from the Heart disease or not.
The dataset is from 'Kaggle'.
The dataset contains 14 columns, including the target column, which indicates the presence or absence of heart disease. Here is a brief description of each column:

    age: Age of the patient in years.
    sex: Sex of the patient. 1 = male, 0 = female.
    cp: Chest pain type experienced by the patient. There are four types:

    0 = typical angina
    1 = atypical angina
    2 = non-anginal pain
    3 = asymptomatic

    trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) when the patient was admitted to the hospital.
    chol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl) when the patient was admitted to the hospital.
    fbs: Fasting blood sugar level (> 120 mg/dl or not). 1 = true, 0 = false.
    restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results. There are three possible values:

    0 = normal
    1 = ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

    thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
    exang: Exercise-induced angina. 1 = yes, 0 = no.
    oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
    slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment. There are three possible values:

    0 = upsloping
    1 = flat
    2 = downsloping

    ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
    thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia. There are three possible values:

    1 = normal
    2 = fixed defect
    3 = reversible defect

    target: Presence of heart disease in the patient. 1 = yes, 0 = no.

The goal of the dataset is to use the patient information to predict whether a patient has heart disease.
